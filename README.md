Database	Oracle Database
Tooling	Maven, Node.js, Git
✨ Key Features

    Secure Authentication: User registration and login functionality to protect user data.

    State-Wise Exploration: An interactive grid allowing users to browse pickles based on Indian states.

    Personalized Experience: Dynamic welcome screens that display user-specific details upon login.

    Cart Management: Full CRUD functionality for the shopping cart—add, view, and manage favorite items.

    Responsive Design: A clean, mobile-friendly UI built to provide a consistent experience across devices.

    Persistent Storage: Robust data handling using Oracle for user profiles and regional product catalogs.

🏗️ Architecture

The application follows a standard decoupled architecture:

    Frontend (Angular): Handles the View layer, state-based navigation, and consumes RESTful services.

    Backend (Spring Boot): Manages the Business Logic layer, API endpoints, and handles communication with the database.

    Database (Oracle): Stores relational data for products, states, and user credentials.
